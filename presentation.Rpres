Central limit theorem
========================================================

"In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) states that, given certain conditions, the **arithmetic mean** of a sufficiently large number of iterates of **independent random variables**, each with a well-defined expected value and well-defined variance, will be approximately **normally distributed**, *regardless of the underlying distribution*"

- Wikipedia
    
The Application
========================================================

In order to show visually the effects of this theorem we built a small application that allows the user to set the distribution type and verify that *as the number of iterates grows, the mean if the iterates converges to a normal* distribution.

The application is available at [https://mtiberi.shinyapps.io/devdataprod_app/](https://mtiberi.shinyapps.io/devdataprod_app/)


How to use it
========================================================

- The user chooses one of the available distributions
- The user sets the number if iterations
- The user presses the "Show" button
